# Luhn Algorithm
The Luhn algorithm or Luhn formula, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm, named after its creator, IBM scientist Hans Peter Luhn, is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers or IMEI numbers.

The algorithm is in the public domain and is in wide use today. It is not intended to be a cryptographically secure hash function; it was designed to protect against accidental errors, not malicious attacks. Most credit cards and many government identification numbers use the algorithm as a simple method of distinguishing valid numbers from mistyped or otherwise incorrect numbers.
## General info
The App allows:
- Check if provided sequence is considered valid according to the Luhn's formula. 
- Get digit which, when added to the sequence, will make it valid according to the Luhn's formula.
